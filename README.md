poddy is a dead simple orchestrator for online Git workspaces with the IDE of your choice - all contained in a single binary.

It is similar to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) but with the following main features:

- self-hosted
- easy to setup and configure
- built to support multiple Git providers (currently only Gitlab is supported though)
